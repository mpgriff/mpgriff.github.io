This blog is about surprises.
When I stumble on the counter-intuitive, I plan to share it here.
For context, I am a geophysicist working with surface nuclear magnetic resonance (SNMR) to quantify groundwater. Likely posts will be about SNMR, geophysics and signal processing; but maybe other topics too. 
Thank you.
